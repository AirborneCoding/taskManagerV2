Social:

Tasks related to social interactions.
Calls, events, parties, catching up, etc.
Travel:

Tasks related to travel plans and itineraries.
Booking flights, packing, sightseeing, etc.
Hobbies:

Tasks related to personal interests and hobbies.
Painting, playing an instrument, writing, etc.
Finance:

Budgeting, paying bills, saving, investments, etc.
Home Improvement:

Repairs, renovations, decorating, etc.
Errands:

Tasks that involve running errands or completing small tasks.
Grocery shopping, picking up dry cleaning, etc.
Project Specific:

Tasks related to specific projects.
Launching a website, planning an event, etc.
Goals:

Tasks that contribute to personal or professional goals.
Career milestones, fitness achievements, learning objectives, etc.
------------------------
Not Started / Pending:

This is a common default status. It indicates that the task has been created but hasn't been worked on yet.
Open:

Similar to "Not Started," this status indicates that the task is open and awaiting action.
Upcoming:

This could be used when tasks are scheduled for the future, indicating that they're not relevant until a later date.
New:

This status is often used to mark tasks that have been recently added but haven't been acted upon.
To-Do:

A simple "To-Do" status can represent tasks that are on the user's list to complete.
Active:

This could indicate that the task is currently active or in progress.
Planned:

For tasks that are part of a plan or roadmap but haven't been initiated yet.
Pending Approval:

Suitable if tasks need to go through an approval process before they're officially started.
Backlog:

If you're using an agile approach, tasks might start in a backlog before being moved to active development.
Scheduled:

For tasks that are scheduled to be worked on at a specific time.
--------------
1. User Authentication and Authorization:
Implement a user registration and login system to ensure secure access to the app. You can use technologies like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and authorization to restrict access to certain features based on user roles.

2. Task Creation:
Allow users to create tasks with details such as title, description, due date, priority, and any other relevant information. Use a user-friendly interface to input task details.

3. Task Lists and Categories:
Allow users to organize tasks into different lists or categories. This could be a simple way for users to group related tasks together, making it easier to manage their responsibilities.

4. Task Sorting and Filtering:
Implement options for users to sort tasks by due date, priority, or completion status. Also, provide filtering options to help users quickly find tasks based on specific criteria.

5. Task Editing and Deletion:
Give users the ability to edit task details after creation. Additionally, provide an option to mark tasks as completed and delete tasks that are no longer relevant.

6. Task Reminders and Notifications:
Incorporate reminder functionality, allowing users to set notifications for upcoming due dates. This could be implemented using email notifications or push notifications in the app.

7. Drag-and-Drop Interface:
Consider adding a drag-and-drop interface for reordering tasks within a list or moving tasks between different lists. This can enhance the user experience and make task organization more intuitive.

8. Collaboration and Sharing:
If you want to expand the app's capabilities, allow users to collaborate on tasks. This could involve sharing tasks with other users, assigning tasks to team members, and having the option to comment on tasks.

9. Analytics and Insights:
Provide users with insights into their task management habits. Show them statistics like completed tasks per week, average time to complete tasks, and other relevant metrics.

10. Dark Mode and Customization:
Consider offering different themes, including a dark mode option. Allow users to customize the app's appearance to suit their preferences.

11. Offline Support:
Implement offline support using technologies like service workers so that users can access and interact with their tasks even when they're not connected to the internet.

12. Search Functionality:
Include a search feature that allows users to quickly find tasks based on keywords or specific details.

13. Recurring Tasks:
Allow users to set tasks that repeat at specific intervals (daily, weekly, monthly). This is particularly useful for tasks that occur regularly.

14. Integration with External Calendars:
Give users the option to sync their tasks with external calendar applications like Google Calendar or Apple Calendar.

 const missingFields = [];
 if (!title) {
  missingFields.push("title");
 }

 if (!description) {
  missingFields.push("description");
 }

 if (!category) {
  missingFields.push("category");
 }

 if (missingFields.length > 0) {
  const errorMessage = `Please provide : ${missingFields.join(", ")}`;
  throw new CustomError.BadRequestError(errorMessage);
 }
